# Summary

The main goal of 2022, is list all awesome articles I haved read; Something I haved created; How far is it to realize the dreamã€‚ 

# Basic example

Infinite paper page(like newspaper), user can drag/drap, zoom in and zoom out. 

There are two(maybe more) section

- article
- projects

# Detailed design

datasets: logseq Weekly Summary

theme: black and white, like newspaper

animation: each block in this page should be a article block, focus a block will scale it up, and make others smaller.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on users
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing users adopt it? Is
this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod? Can we provide a runtime adapter library for the original API it replaces? 

# Unresolved questions

- is possible to create a harry potter like image? black and white? image will move for a while like iPhone live photo.
