# Summary

Most of Apps in china will start publish year-of-personal-usage-review at end of year. Why create a personal review page? Just want to seo myself, build-in-public myself, resume myself.

# Basic example

- list awesome things I want to share during this year.
- on the road to become fulltime open-source developer, what process I have got.

...

# Motivation

Treat myself as a App, publish personal review page, includes

- best of articles I haved read
- what I create this year
- what I change this year
- what I learn or get this year

...

# Detailed design

Each year could be uniq(recommend) page or common(could be reused in next year) page. I will create a new rfc named `00x-year.md` in review folder.

## When

It should start before two months before end of the year.

## What

It should be static website. In rfc, it should explain this year review page UI looks like, it should be excalidraw or something else. 

## Publish

Publish it in reddit or hacknews.
