# Summary

Manage draft rfcs.

# Basic example

```console
├── projects
│   └── drafts
│       └── DRAFT-000-rss.md
```

Drafts rfc is very early stage of project feature, maybe implemented in the feature, or inactive. Save it into draft folder

Draft template should much short. Only contain `meta` `Summary` `Basic example` `Motivation` `Reason`. It's better to give ref links that inspires you.

# Motivation

Some ideas suddenly come to mind.
